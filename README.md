# filter-only-english-written-jobs-in-xing.com
I wrote a script for xing.com to ignore the German language job posts and also remove the repetitive ones(based on the title and the company name) to reduce distraction and save time.

## How to use it?
- Open the xing.com job search
- Do your search
- Open the browser developer tools (press F12 on the keyboard or from the menu -> tools select developer tools)
- Open the console tab
- Copy the code from the script.js file
- Paste the code into the Console tab and press enter
